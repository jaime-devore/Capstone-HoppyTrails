>"I am out with my friends and my dog. We've just finished up at a brewery and want to find the next brewery to go to. I don't want to have to go all the way to Google and type in 'brewery near me' then click on all these pages and then type in 'does brewery allow pets'. I don't have time for that. I just want to be told where to go."

## Description

HoppyTrails allows registered Users to browse curated trails based on four criteria: 

    - Pet Friendly
    - Family Friendly
    - Patio
    - Budget

Each route contains a list of four Cleveland Breweries that fit the trail description. Users can view those breweries and mark trails as 'Complete' when finished. Marking a trail 'Complete' adds a stamp to their profile. Users can also search through all available breweries, read and leave reviews, and view all reviews they left for each brewery.
