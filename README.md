>"I am out with my friends and my dog. We've just finished up at a brewery and want to find the next brewery to go to. I don't want to have to go all the way to Google and type in 'brewery near me' then click on all these pages and then type in 'does brewery allow pets'. I don't have time for that. I just want to be told where to go."

## Description
HoppyTrails allows registered Users to browse curated trails based on four criteria: 
  * Pet Friendly
  * Family Friendly
  * Patio
  * Budget

Each route contains a list of four Cleveland Breweries that fit the trail description. Users can view those breweries and mark trails as 'Complete' when finished. Marking a trail 'Complete' adds a stamp to their profile. Users can also search through all available breweries, read and leave reviews, and view all reviews they left for each brewery.

## Tech Stack
  * Database: SQL Server
  * Backend: .NET, C#
  * Frontend: VUE.JS, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Installation
The HoppyTrails database was built using SQL Server in Microsoft SQL Server. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2018 was used as the Relational Database Management System(RDBMS). The database creation file can be found in the 'database' folder, dotnet/database/capstone.sql. Opening this file and executing the query will create the database and populate the default data.

The HoppyTrails server was built using C# in Visual Studio 2022. The solution file can be found in the 'dotnet' folder, dotnet/Capstone.sln. Opening this file and selecting IIS Express should spin up the server.

The HoppyTrails front end was built using Vue in Visual Studio Code. Node.js is required for JavaScript support. Right-Click on the 'vue' folder and select 'Open with Code'. Open a new Terminal window and type 'npm install'. Once the install is complete, type 'npm run serve'. CTRL+Click the link following 'Local:'.
